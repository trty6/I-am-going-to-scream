As some people say, second place is first loser. In this case, the second number is first loser, and that is why it is last. Additionally, its never a good amount of anything.

(Included in this list of anything but not limited to: Tests, friends, people trying to kill you, dogs because you need at minimum 12, and pencils.)

## Number 9

Number 3 is on this list at the 9th spot due to it also being an inadequate amount of dogs to own. You need more. More dogs. Also, it is half of the unluckiest number on this list.

## Number 8

Coming in at 8th place, we have number 6! This number is an extremely cool number, and is a good amount of nearly everything. However, it is considered an unlucky number, so it has been bumped back. How unlucky!

## Number 7

At number 7 is the number 10. Unfortunately for ten, it didn't do so well since its not a 10 out of 10. So while 10 is literally 10, 10 is not 10 of 10 because 10 is simply 10.

## Number 6

At the 6th position, is the number 4! Four is here for four poor reason, for four, when brought forth before four people, was arrested for violating international law. It was cool looking though, so thats why they are in 6th. They should probably be in prison though.

## Number 5

At number 5 is number 8, which is not to be confused with the number in position 8, number 6. While number 6 may appear like number 8, 8 and 6 are not the same, and if you switched all 8's with 6's there would be a much more confusing list of best 10 numbers in the first 10 numbers, since 9 would not be ate by 7, but 8 might be ate by 6 or 9.

## Number 4

At number 4 is number 5, which is just behind number 3 on the list, but its still be4 5. 5 kinda sucks tho...
