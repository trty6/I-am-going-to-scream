# Top ten numbers from ONE TO TEN
## Number 10
2

This is simply due to it being the only even prime number, and never a good thing. A two is never good, its never a good amount of anything.

Included in this but not limited to: Tests, friends, people trying to kill you, dogs (you need more), and pencils.
## Number 9
3

Number 3 is on this list at the 9th spot due to it also being an inadequate amount of dogs to own. You need more.

## Number 8
