# Top ten numbers from ONE TO TEN

## Number 10 <br>

This is simply due to it being the only even prime number, and never a good thing. A two is never good, its never a good amount of anything.

Included in this but not limited to: Tests, friends, people trying to kill you, dogs (you need more), and pencils.

## Number 9
3

Number 3 is on this list at the 9th spot due to it also being an inadequate amount of dogs to own. You need more.

## Number 8
6

Coming in at 8th place, we have number 6! This number is an extremely cool number, and is a good amount of nearly everything. However, it is considered an unlucky number, so it has been bumped back. How unlucky!
