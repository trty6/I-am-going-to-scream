As some people say, second place is first loser. In this case, the second number is first loser, and that is why it is last. Additionally, its never a good amount of anything.

(Included in this list of anything but not limited to: Tests, friends, people trying to kill you, dogs because you need at minimum 12, and pencils.)

## Number 9
3

Number 3 is on this list at the 9th spot due to it also being an inadequate amount of dogs to own. You need more. More dogs. Also, it is half of the unluckiest number on this list.

## Number 8
6

Coming in at 8th place, we have number 6! This number is an extremely cool number, and is a good amount of nearly everything. However, it is considered an unlucky number, so it has been bumped back. How unlucky!
